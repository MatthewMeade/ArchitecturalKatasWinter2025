# Managed AI Model vs Self Managed (Cloud-Based)

## Context

Certifiable, Inc. needs to decide how to deploy and manage the AI models used for preliminary grading. The two primary options are using a managed AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere) or self-managing the model on their existing cloud infrastructure. This decision impacts cost, control, and maintenance.

## Decision

- Certifiable, Inc. will self-manage the AI model deployment on their existing cloud infrastructure

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
    - **Data Privacy:** Sensitive candidate data and proprietary information remain within the company's controlled cloud environment. This is crucial for compliance and security.
    - **Cost Control:** Potentially lower long-term costs compared to per-token usage fees of managed services, especially at high volumes. Avoids API usage limits.
    - **Flexibility and Customization:** Full control over model selection, fine-tuning, and infrastructure configuration. No vendor lock-in. Ability to choose open-source models.
    - **Latency Control:** Potentially lower and more predictable latency, as the model is hosted within the company's cloud network.
    - **Integration with Existing Infrastructure:** Easier integration with other services and data already within the company's cloud environment.

- **Negative:**
    - **Increased Infrastructure Management:** Requires managing virtual machines, GPU/TPU instances, and related software. This increases operational overhead, although less than managing physical hardware.
    - **Expertise Required:** Needs in-house expertise in machine learning infrastructure, cloud computing, and model deployment.
    - **Maintenance Responsibility:** The company is responsible for model updates, security patches, scaling the infrastructure (e.g., configuring auto-scaling), and managing cloud resources.
	- **Higher Initial Costs:** Setting up the cloud infrastructure can be more expensive initially.
