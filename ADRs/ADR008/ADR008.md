# What Part of the Architecture Would Benefit from AI

## Context

 Multiple areas within the current system could potentially benefit from AI integration:

* **Grading Short Answers:**  Assisting experts in grading the short answer questions in Test 1.
* **Grading Architecture Assignment:** Assisting experts in grading the architecture submissions in Test 2.
* **Analyzing Aptitude Test Reports:** Identifying problematic questions or trends in candidate responses.
* **Modifying Aptitude Tests:**  Suggesting changes to existing questions or creating new questions.
* **Creating/Modifying Case Studies:**  Assisting in the creation and updating of case studies.
* **Updating Grading Criteria:**  Identifying changes in industry trends and suggesting updates to grading criteria.
* **Administrative Tasks:**  Automating tasks like maintaining the expert database.
* **Translation of test materials**
* **Analyzing trends over time**

## Decision

The initial focus of AI integration will be limited to assisting with the grading of both short answers (Test 1) and architecture submissions (Test 2).
- **Direct Impact on Bottleneck:** Grading is the most time-consuming and expensive part of the current process, making it the most impactful area for improvement.
- **Clear Value Proposition:**  The benefits of AI-assisted grading (reduced time, cost savings) are readily quantifiable.
- **Manageable Scope:**  Focusing on grading allows for a more manageable initial implementation, reducing risk.
- **Foundation for Future Improvements:**  The infrastructure and expertise gained from implementing AI grading can be leveraged for other AI applications in the future.
- **Addresses immediate need:** of scaling the grading to accommodate the large increase in submissions.

## Consequences

- **Reduced Grading Time:**  AI assistance can significantly reduce the time it takes experts to grade exams, addressing the primary bottleneck in the certification process.
- **Cost Savings:**  Reduced grading time translates directly to cost savings, as experts are paid hourly.
- **Improved Scalability:**  The AI-assisted grading process can handle the anticipated 5-10x increase in candidates more easily.
- **Consistency:**  AI can help ensure consistent application of grading criteria, reducing potential bias.
- **Faster Turnaround:** Contributes to maintaining the 1-week turnaround guarantee.
