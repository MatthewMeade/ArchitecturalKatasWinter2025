# Model Requirements for Architecture Submission Grading

## Context

Candidates' architecture submissions (Test 2) may include diagrams, charts, and other visual elements in addition to text. The AI model assisting with grading needs to be able to understand these visual components.

## Decision

The AI model used for grading architecture submissions must be multi-modal, capable of processing and understanding both text and images.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
    - Enables the AI to analyze the complete submission, including diagrams, leading to more accurate and comprehensive assessments.

- **Negative:**
    - Multi-modal models may be more complex and potentially more resource-intensive than text-only models.
    - The availability of suitable multi-modal models meeting all other requirements (performance, cost, etc.) may be more limited.
