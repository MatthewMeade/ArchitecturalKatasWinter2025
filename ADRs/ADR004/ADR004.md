# Test 1 Architecture

## Context

The grading step for Test 2 includes the candidate's responses submission to a architecture case study problem. How can AI be used to assist in grading? 


## Decision

- A new AI grader service will be placed between the candidate submission database and the manual grading service
- This service will read in submissions ready to be graded, grade them, and place the output in a database
    - The output will include a grade, and detailed justification
- To retrieve the relevant context for grading, the service will use RAG to query the questions db for grading criteria and information
- The service will implement an Agent to anonymously determine if all grading criteria has been covered by it's evaluation
- Multiple instances of the AI grader service can be deployed to process submissions in parallel

## Consequences

The expert grader will receive a breakdown of the candidate's submission with suggested grades and justifications. This will reduce
the amount of time it takes for the expert to grade the submission by highlighting areas to focus on.
