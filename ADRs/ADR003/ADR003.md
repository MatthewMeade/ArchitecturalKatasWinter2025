# Test 1 Architecture

## Context

The grading step for Test 1 includes the candidate's responses to short answer questions. How can AI be used to assist in grading? 

## Decision

- A new AI grader service will be placed between the candidate submission database and the manual grading service
- This service will read in questions ready to be graded, grade them, and place the output in a database
    - The output will include a grade and justification
- To retrieve the relevant context for grading, the service will use RAG to query the questions db for grading criteria and information
- The expert grader can accept the output or override it with their own grade and justification
- Multiple instances of the AI grader service can be deployed to process submissions in parallel

## Consequences

The expert grader will receive the questions to be graded with a preliminary grade and justification. This will save the expert time when they can accept the AI grade and continue to the next question
